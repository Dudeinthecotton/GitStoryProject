<h1>A new ending for the original Matrix movie, completed</h1>

<h2> Chapter 3: A  whole new outlook </h2>

<p>The Green guy barely seems to even notice the miracle he just pulled off before he leaps into the sky, colliding with a giant mechanical Wyrm coated in alien life forms. Neo simply sits there, slowly re-realizing the incredible pain still in his legs. However, this is the first time since entering the dream state that Neo finally has time to think by himself.</p>

<p>As he waits there, he begins to realize that despite the apocalypse occurring around him nothing is coming close enough to harm him. He also begins to ponder on how convenient his rescue was. It soon dawns on him that these are not coincidences, but outcomes from his presence. As "the one" His desires are fluctuating the world around him, giving him the power to essentially reign as a god within this domain. With this power, came a terrible desire.</p>

<p>Unfotrunately these thoguhts would not come to fruition, as while he lay there contemplating his soon-to-be kingdom, a lone appendage was making it's way toward him. The metalic arm of the former robot assassin was now scrapping along the ground towards him, using it's base which should be connected to a shoulder as a prop for the hand to lash forwards. If viewed from a distance one could be mistaken for viewing it as a metalic slug creature. However Neo didn't make that mistake, for he didn't see it at all due to his nirvana esque joy at survival. A joy which was about to be extinguished in a most unfortunate and ironic manner.</p>
